2. Linux Fundamentals
   - File system navigation
   - File permissions
   - Shell basics & scripting
   Resources:
     - HackerSploit Linux Essentials series
     - OverTheWire Bandit wargame

3. Introduction to Ethical Hacking
   - What is pentesting?
   - Types: Web, Mobile, Network
   - Methodology overview

Practice:
   - Complete OverTheWire Bandit levels 1-10
   - Setup Kali Linux in VM

PHASE 2: WEB PENTESTING BASICS (Weeks 5-8)
------------------------------------------
Goal: Learn how to find and exploit common web vulnerabilities.

1. Web Technologies
   - HTML, CSS, JS basics
   - HTTP requests/responses
   - Cookies & sessions

2. Web Vulnerabilities
   - SQL Injection
   - XSS (Reflected, Stored, DOM)

   - File Inclusion
   - Authentication bypass

Tools:
   - Burp Suite
   - OWASP ZAP

Practice:
   - DVWA
   - HackTheBox Starting Point web challenges

---

PHASE 3: NETWORK PENTESTING (Weeks 9-12)
-----------------------------------------
Goal: Learn to scan, enumerate, and exploit network services.

1. Recon & Scanning
   - Nmap
   - Masscan
   - Service enumeration

2. Exploitation
   - SMB, FTP, SSH attacks
   - Metasploit basics

Practice:
   - HackTheBox Starting Point network challenges

---

PHASE 4: MOBILE APP PENTESTING (Weeks 13-16)
---------------------------------------------
Goal: Understand Android & iOS security models and test apps.

1. Android Basics
   - APK structure
   - Frida & Objection basics
   - SSL pinning bypass

2. Mobile Vulnerabilities
   - Insecure storage
   - Weak authentication
   - API misconfigurations

Practice:
   - Install vulnerable APKs in emulator
   - Use Burp Suite with mobile apps

---

PHASE 5: API & BACKEND SECURITY (Weeks 17-20)
----------------------------------------------
Goal: Learn API attacks and secure backend coding practices.

1. REST & GraphQL APIs
   - Authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

2. Attacks
   - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
   - Mass assignment
   - Injection attacks

Practice:
   - Build a small Node.js or Python API
   - Test with Postman & Burp Suite

---

PHASE 6: ADVANCED & REALISTIC PRACTICE (Weeks 21-52)
-----------------------------------------------------
Goal: Work like a real pentester.

1. Advanced Exploitation
   - Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows)
   - Active Directory attacks
   - Pivoting

2. Realistic Labs
   - HackTheBox (regular + retired boxes)
   - TryHackMe Advanced paths

3. Reporting
   - Learn to write professional pentest reports

---

End Goal:
By the end of the year, you should have:
- A strong portfolio of documented pentests
- Competence in both web & mobile pentesting
- Experience with API security testing
