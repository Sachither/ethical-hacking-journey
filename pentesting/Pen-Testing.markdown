# Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is the process of simulating an attack on a network or system to evaluate its security posture and identify exploitable vulnerabilities. This is achieved by simulating various types of attacks on the target network or host.

## Essential InfoSec Terminology
- **Threat**: A malicious actor aiming to breach, damage, steal, or exfiltrate data from a network or system.
- **Asset**: Business- or service-critical systems that store data, provide services to clients, or are integral to company operations.
- **Risk**: The potential impact of a threat or vulnerability on an organization.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in a system or network that, when exploited, compromises its integrity and security, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Exploit**: The process of breaking into a system or network through a specific vulnerability.
- **Payload**: A chunk of exploit code designed to perform specific tasks on the target system (e.g., destroying data, exfiltrating data, or setting up backdoor access).
- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: A vulnerability that has not yet been patched by the developer.

### CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
The CIA Triad is a model for keeping information secure, maintaining its integrity, and ensuring its availability. It includes five essential features:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Maintains the accuracy and trustworthiness of data, preventing unauthorized changes.
- **Availability**: Ensures systems storing and processing data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Authenticity**: Verifies that communications or data transfers are genuine.
- **Non-Repudiation**: Ensures that communication between sender and recipient cannot be denied.

## Penetration Testing Agreement
- **Scope**: Defines the targets and boundaries of the test.
- **Timing**: Specifies the duration and schedule of the test.

## Importance of Penetration Testing
- Tests security controls and policies.
- Identifies threats and vulnerabilities.
- Ensures compliance with regulations.
- Tests security infrastructure (e.g., firewalls, WAFs).
- Validates new hardware, software, or organizational infrastructure.

## Blue Team
The Blue Team is the defensive team responsible for:
- Conducting vulnerability assessments and security audits to identify weaknesses.
- Testing the effectiveness of security controls.
- Providing an overall security posture report to upper management.
- Defending against attacks and predicting/preventing future ones.

## Red Team
The Red Team is the offensive team that:
- Simulates attacks on assets and digital infrastructure.
- Tests the overall security posture to identify exploitable weaknesses.

## Types of Penetration Testing
- **Black Box Testing**: The Red Team has no prior knowledge of the infrastructure or assets, starting only with the company name or website.
- **White Box Testing**: The tester has complete knowledge of the digital infrastructure, used to test specific areas of the organization.
- **Grey Box Testing**: Combines black and white box testing to simulate attacks from both insiders and external threats.

## Penetration Testing Phases
1. **Pre-Engagement**: Defines the scope, targets, and rules of engagement.
2. **Information Gathering (OSINT)**: Collects data about the target using passive and active techniques.
3. **Threat Modeling and Vulnerability Identification**: Identifies threats affecting the infrastructure and builds a profile of likely attack vectors.
4. **Exploitation**: Exploits identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Gains sensitive information and establishes a foothold in the system.
6. **Reporting**: Summarizes findings, vulnerabilities exploited, and their potential impact on the organization’s business and financials.

## Penetration Testing Methodology
A penetration testing methodology is a systematic approach to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization’s security posture.
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides a clear, methodical, and systematic testing process.
  - Ensures tests are reliable, accurate, and consistent.
- **Requirements**: Methodologies must be comprehensive and accurate, yielding consistent results regardless of the tester.
- **Types**: Proprietary and open-source methodologies.
